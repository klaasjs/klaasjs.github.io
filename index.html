		<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far,<br/>
		far away....</p>

		<p>It is a period of civil war.<br/>
		Rebel spaceships, striking<br/>
		from a hidden base, have won<br/>
		their first victory against<br/>
		the evil Galactic Empire.</p>
		
		<p>During the battle, rebel<br/>
		spies managed to steal secret<br/>
		plans to the Empire's<br/>
		ultimate weapon, the DEATH<br/>
		STAR, an armored space<br/>
		station with enough power to<br/>
		destroy an entire planet.</p>
		
		<p>Pursued by the Empire's<br/>
		sinister agents, Princess<br/>
		Leia races home aboard her<br/>
		starship, custodian of the<br/>
		stolen plans that can save<br/>
		her people and restore<br/>
		freedom to the galaxy....</p>
		
		<p>Cue epic X-Wing vs TIE fighter battle..</p>
